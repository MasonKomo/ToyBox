# ToyBox

ToyBox is a Flutter application inspired by the chaos that is the result of having two young children and way too many toys. Too often I found the state of our home out of control. With toys covering virtually every inch of the floor, I decided it was time for a change. So I began working on ToyBox. The idea is to build an app that will allow children to check out toys just like a library system. 

## Basic Features

- Check in / Check out toys.
= Specify limits on number of toys that can be checked out at any given time.
- Track statistical data such as number of times a toy has been checked out, play time, etc.

## Future Goals

- Allow for users to catagorize toys into group that can help with toy rotation (which is proven to promote development in children!)
- Provide statistics on toys and suggest new toys that aren't getting as much play time. 
- Provide a random suggested toy of the day for each child.
- Conduct more research into the benifits of toy rotation using the fuctionalities of ToyBox as a tool.
